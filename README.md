### Preset translator
To use the preset translator, first you need to follow these steps:

**1.** Set up the SillyTavern folder (optional) or use custom folder **(IMPORTANT!)**.
\
**2.** Set up the language the preset will be translated to and there is an optional box to select if want to translate content inside <>.
* **Translate wrapped `<>`**: this one is experimental, you can translate any content inside <>, for example, `<think>` can be translated to `<考える>`

**3.** Select the .JSON files to be translated.
\
**4.** Name the file and save it.

### Card translator
To use the card translator, first you need to follow these steps:

**1.** Set up your interface language.\
**2.** Select the SillyTavern folder **(IMPORTANT!)**.\
**3.** Set up the translator.\
Setting up the translator is important, customizations for Non-LLMs and LLMs:

Non-LLMs
* **Translate name**: you can translate, the character card name from, for example, `James` (en) to `ジェームズ` (ja) if the option is enabled.
* **Translate wrapped `<>`**: this one is experimental, you can translate any content inside <>, for example, `<think>` can be translated to `<考える>`
* **Translate wrapped `()`**: translates content inside parentheses separated from the rest of the text
* **Translate wrapped `[]`**: translates content inside brackets separated from the rest of the text
* **Use Jane (placeholder) instead of {{char}} during translation**: Enabling placeholder may improve translation coherence and returns back to {{char}} after the translation is done


LLMs
* **Translate name**: you can translate, the character card name from, for example, `James` (en) to `ジェームズ` (ja) if the option is enabled.
* **Translate wrapped `<>`**: this one is experimental, you can translate any content inside <>, for example, `<think>` can be translated to `<考える>`
* **Use characters's name instead of {{char}}**: may improve coherence, uses character's name to translate and after translation goes back to {{char}}
* **Select character's gender**: optional, may improve coherence with pronouns
  

**4.** For Non-LLMs: Select the translation service. OR for LLMs: Select the model and insert the API key

**5.** Enable monitoring.

After enabling the monitoring, it will scan any file inside SillyTavern's character folder to translate, backing up the original file in `Original` folder where the tool is localted, if you want to restore the original files you can press the number `3` in your keyboard and it will restore the files. **The restored original files will not be translated until the second option, `2` is selected, to clean all the translated files status.**
